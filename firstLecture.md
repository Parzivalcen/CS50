# First Lecture
CS is fundamentally problem solving, but we have to be precise and concise or the computers wont understand what are trying to express. 

It start explaining us how computers can only talk with zeros and ones, and to represent thinks like letters we humans created systems or mapping of specific patterns of zeros and ones that represent these letters for example the ASCII system and UNICODE, that have and specific pattern of numbers represented by zeroes and ones assigned to them. By using context like file extensions programs can represent these binary digits as Numbers or Letters

## Computer program. 
A computer program takes and input, perform an algorithm and the it ouputs the result of the algorithm, a computer program does this many times usually, developers deconstruct large problems doing mini programs out of them. Also known as Problem Solving and it scale as they solve the problems.
 
## Algorithms.
Step by Step instructions for solving some problem. **INPUT -> [algorithm] -> OUTPUT**

Algorithms are the way programmers solve problems, some algorithms could solve the problem but be very inefficient, we have to find the most efficient and make sure that it solves the problem.

## Pseudocode.
Is a way of getting your Idea of how you are going to solve the problem correctly across
