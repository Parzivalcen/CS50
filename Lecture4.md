# Algorithms 

## Arrays
arrays don't use a single place in memory they are store bite after bite

Computers go through arrays like `{1, 2, 4, 5, 0}` one by one they don have a birds eyes like we have, so for things like sorting it has to look at every character and do the tasks one by one. 

## Big *O* Notations
They are use to measure the running time of the algorithm that we use. It is mostly to convey an idea of running time not the exact milliseconds or steps.

Some common running times are:
- O(n)
- O(n log n)
- O(n^2) 
- O(log n)
- O(1)
## Big *Ω* (omega) Notation
Is least number of steps that an algorithm can do, or how many steps in will our algorithm to run in the best case scenario, **Big *O*** how many steps it would take in the worst case scenario
- Ω(n)
- Ω(n log n)
- Ω(n^2) 
- Ω(log n)
- Ω(1)
## Big *Theta* 
It is used when the big "O" and big "Ω" are the same value  
- An algorithm with a O(1) Notation means that a constant number of steps is require, no matter the size of the problem 

## Search Algorithms 
 ### Linear
 They simply go from left to right or even right to left IIRC
